Diefining expectations

Define your strengths: organization, getting clarity before moving forward, teaching/learning/getting feedback, compromise

How you wan to work with someone else? I generally want some quiet time to process and wrap my mind around the initial problem, then start talking it out and working together closely. Don't like to just jump in, like to get the framework/domain organization before jumping in.

How do you appreciate communication? I appreciate communication in writing if longer, otherwise in person. dislike texts.

git worklow: TBD

How can you communicated expecatiations to someone very different from you? Include my rationale, and don't be afraid to ask for it.

Decide on additonal questions...
